# calendar-map

Example: [http://www.cluelesscycling.com/calendar-map/index.html](https://github.com/vitohuang/calendar-map)

Pull in calendar events and put it on a map to visualise it, this is very usefull when plan a trip etc.

At the moment, this will reads in a json file and display it, there will be a seperate backend to download the calendar event (from Google calendar) and convert that into json file.
